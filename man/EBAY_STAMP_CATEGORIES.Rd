Total: 438 stamp categories across 16 regions
}
\section{Category Structure}{

The eBay stamp categories are organized hierarchically:
- Level 1: "Stamps" (category 260) - PARENT, NOT A LEAF
- Level 2: Regions (16 total) - Most are NOT leaf categories
- Level 3: Countries/Subcategories - LEAF categories (can create listings)
}

\section{Critical Rules}{

- eBay requires LEAF categories for listing creation
- Using parent categories results in Error 87
- Only "Other Stamps" (170137) is a leaf at region level
}
