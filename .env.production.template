# Delcampe Production Environment Variables Template
# ===================================================
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a TEMPLATE file for documentation purposes.
# Copy this to .env.production and fill in your actual values.
#
# .env.production is NOT checked into git for security reasons.
# Keep it secure and NEVER commit it to version control.

# eBay OAuth Application Credentials (Production)
# ------------------------------------------------
# These are YOUR OAuth application credentials from:
# https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys
#
# IMPORTANT: These are OAuth APP credentials, NOT user tokens!
# - User tokens are managed per-user in the database via OAuth flow
# - Each user will authenticate their own eBay account
# - These credentials allow YOUR app to facilitate OAuth

EBAY_PROD_CLIENT_ID=YourAppName-YourAppID-PRD-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx

# eBay Environment
# ----------------
# Set to "production" for real eBay listings
# Set to "sandbox" for testing
EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=production

# ==============================================================================
# WHAT NOT TO PUT HERE
# ==============================================================================
#
# DO NOT put user-specific API keys here:
# ✗ Claude API keys (user-managed in app data files)
# ✗ OpenAI API keys (user-managed in app data files)
# ✗ eBay user access tokens (managed per-user via OAuth in database)
#
# These are managed by users themselves through the application UI.
#
# DO NOT put development credentials here:
# ✗ Sandbox credentials belong in .Renviron for local development
# ✗ Test database paths
# ✗ Debug settings
#
# ==============================================================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ==============================================================================
#
# 1. This file contains PRODUCTION OAuth app credentials
# 2. Keep file permissions restrictive: chmod 600 .env.production
# 3. Never commit this file to git (.gitignore handles this)
# 4. Rotate credentials if they are ever exposed
# 5. Use separate OAuth apps for development (sandbox) vs production
#
# ==============================================================================
